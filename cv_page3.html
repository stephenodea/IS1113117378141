                <h2>Eason</h2>
                <p>As part of my transition year programme in school, I worked in Eason in the Parkway shopping centre for a week. 
                During my time, I assisted customers, stocked shelves, managed deliveries, and priced goods. 
                It was my first time working in retail and it was an enjoyable experience.</p>
                <h2>Donal Morrissey & Co.</h2>
                <p>During my second term of work experience in the transition year programme, I worked in Donal Morrissey & Co. Accountancy.
                I have always been interested in accountancy and I enjoyed the week overall.
                I recorded accounts on Microsoft Excel, managed files, and recorded payments in appropriate accounts.
                </p>
                <h2>Farming</h2>
                <p>Throughout my life, I have worked on a farm in Limerick.
                My father is a farmed and I help out frequently.
                I do jobs such as milking cows, feeding calves, cleaning out sheds, drawing bale silage, and feeding cows.
                Farming is very enjoyable and it is a great way appreciating the country side!</p>
