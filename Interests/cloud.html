        <h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
        <p>Cloud computing is a topic I have always been interested in.
        It inspired me to set up my own business that sells cloud computing products.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>With cloud computing, if you have got an internet connection you can be at work. 
        And with most serious cloud services offering mobile apps, you are not restricted by which device you have got to hand.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Lost laptops are a billion dollar business problem. 
    And potentially greater than the loss of an expensive piece of kit is the loss of the sensitive data inside it. 
    Cloud computing gives you greater security when this happens. 
    Because your data is stored in the cloud, you can access it no matter what happens to your machine. 
    And you can even remotely wipe data from lost laptops so it does not get into the wrong hands.</p>
