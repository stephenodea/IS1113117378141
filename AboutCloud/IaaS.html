        <h1>Infrastructure as a Service</h1>
        <img src="https://www.techfunnel.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/What-Is-IaaS.jpg" height="150" width="175">
        <p>In an IaaS model, a cloud provider hosts the infrastructure components traditionally present in an on-premises data center, including servers, storage and networking hardware, as well as the virtualization or hypervisor layer.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>IaaS customers access resources and services through a wide area network (WAN), such as the internet, and can use the cloud provider's services to install the remaining elements of an application stack. For example, the user can log in to the IaaS platform to create virtual machines (VMs); install operating systems in each VM; deploy middleware, such as databases; create storage buckets for workloads and backups; and install the enterprise workload into that VM. Customers can then use the provider's services to track costs, monitor performance, balance network traffic, troubleshoot application issues, manage disaster recovery and more.</p>
        <br/>

        <br/>
        <li><strong>Free from limitation:</strong> As data requirements increase, the need for hardware also increases.
        IaaS solves this endless treadmill of upgrading and purchasing new technology for your IT staff allowing them to have uninterrupted access to data and applications.</li>
