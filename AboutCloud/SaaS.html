        <h1>Software as a Service</h1>
        <img src="http://guestware.com/Assets/img/Uploads/Cloud-SaaS.png" height="150" width="190">
        <p>Software as a service is a way of delivering centrally hosted applications over the Internet as a service. 
        SaaS applications are sometimes called web-based software, on-demand software, or hosted software. 
        Whatever the name, SaaS applications run on a SaaS providers servers.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Instead of installing and maintaining software, you simply access it via the Internet, freeing yourself from complex software and hardware management. 
        The provider manages access to the application, including security, availability, and performance. 
        SaaS business applications are usually accessed by users using a thin client via a web browser.</p>
        <h2>Why SaaS?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reduced time to benefit:</strong>Different from the traditional model, in SaaS the software (application) is already installed and configured. 
            The user has the advantage of provisioning the server for an instance in cloud and in a couple hours they can have the application ready for use. 
            This reduces the time spent in installation and configuration, and can reduce the issues that  can get in the way of  the software deployment.</li>
            <br/>
            <li><strong>Lower costs:</strong>SaaS has a differential regarding costs since it usually resides in a shared or multitenant environment where the hardware and software license costs are low compared with the traditional model.
            Another advantage is that the customer base can be increased since it allows small and medium  businesses (SMB) to use a software that otherwise they would not use due to the high cost of license.
            Maintenance costs are reduced as well, since the SaaS provider owns the environment and it is split among all customers that use that solution.</li>
            <br/>
            <li><strong>Scalability and integration:</strong>Usually, SaaS solutions reside in cloud environments that are scalable and have integration with other SaaS offerings. 
            Comparing with the traditional model, users do not have to buy another server or software. 
            They only need to enable a new SaaS offering and, in terms of server capacity planning, the SaaS provider will own that.</li>
        </ul>
