        <h1>Platform as a Service</h1>
        <img src="http://crgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/cloud-icon-1.png" height="150" width="190">
        <p>Platform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model in which a third-party provider delivers hardware and software tools, usually those needed for application development to users over the internet. 
        A PaaS provider hosts the hardware and software on its own infrastructure. 
        As a result, PaaS frees users from having to install in-house hardware and software to develop or run a new application.</p>
        <h2>Why PaaS?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Server and storage overhead:</strong>With a PaaS, companies do not have excess resources in reserve. 
            The development tools are provided by the PaaS, and not all of the iterations of the code need to be stored in the data center. 
            These savings on server and storage overhead are realized whether developing on-premises or in the cloud.</li>
            <li><strong>Network bandwidth:</strong>The development and deployment process can put a strain on network bandwidth within a data center. 
            Development teams must perform workload testing to see how the application will perform under different circumstances. 
            This requirement to allocate network resources may slow down the operation of other applications or may require the acquisition of more bandwidth capacity. 
            PaaS enables testing to be done in the cloud, rather than in the data center.</li>
