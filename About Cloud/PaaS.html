        <h1>Platform as a Service</h1>
        <p>Platform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model in which a third-party provider delivers hardware and software tools -- usually those needed for application development -- to users over the internet. 
        A PaaS provider hosts the hardware and software on its own infrastructure. 
        As a result, PaaS frees users from having to install in-house hardware and software to develop or run a new application.</p>
        <h1>Advantages of PaaS</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Server and storage overhead:</strong>With a PaaS, companies don’t have excess resources in reserve. 
            The development tools are provided by the PaaS, and not all of the iterations of the code need to be stored in the data center. 
            These savings on server and storage overhead are realized whether developing on-premises or in the cloud.</li>
            <li><strong>Network bandwidth:</strong>The development and deployment process can put a strain on network bandwidth within a data center. 
            Development teams must perform workload testing to see how the application will perform under different circumstances. 
            This requirement to allocate network resources may slow down the operation of other applications or may require the acquisition of more bandwidth capacity. 
            PaaS enables testing to be done in the cloud, rather than in the data center.</li> 
        </ul>
        <h1>Our product: Cloud 9</h1>
        <p>Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. 
        It includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal. 
        Cloud9 comes pre-packaged with essential tools for popular programming languages including JavaScript, Python, PHP, and more, so you don’t need to install files or configure your development machine to start new projects. 
        Since your Cloud9 IDE is cloud-based, you can work on your projects from your office, home, or anywhere using an internet-connected machine. 
        Cloud9 also provides a seamless experience for developing serverless applications allowing you to easily define resources, debug, and switch between local and remote execution of serverless applications. 
        With Cloud9, you can quickly share your development environment with your team, allowing you to pair program and track each other's inputs in real-time.</p>
