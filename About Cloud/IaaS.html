        <h1>Infrastructure as a Service</h1>
        <p>In an IaaS model, a cloud provider hosts the infrastructure components traditionally present in an on-premises data center, including servers, storage and networking hardware, as well as the virtualization or hypervisor layer.</p>
        <p>The IaaS provider also supplies a range of services to accompany those infrastructure components. These can include detailed billing, monitoring, log access, security, load balancing and clustering, as well as storage resiliency, such as backup, replication and recovery. These services are increasingly policy-driven, enabling IaaS users to implement greater levels of automation and orchestration for important infrastructure tasks. For example, a user can implement policies to drive load balancing to maintain application availability and performance.</p>
        <p>IaaS customers access resources and services through a wide area network (WAN), such as the internet, and can use the cloud provider's services to install the remaining elements of an application stack. For example, the user can log in to the IaaS platform to create virtual machines (VMs); install operating systems in each VM; deploy middleware, such as databases; create storage buckets for workloads and backups; and install the enterprise workload into that VM. Customers can then use the provider's services to track costs, monitor performance, balance network traffic, troubleshoot application issues, manage disaster recovery and more.</p>
        <p>Any cloud computing model requires the participation of a provider. 
        The provider is often a third-party organization that specializes in selling IaaS. 
        Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) are examples of independent IaaS providers. 
        A business might also opt to deploy a private cloud, becoming its own provider of infrastructure services.</p>
